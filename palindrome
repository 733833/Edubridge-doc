Write a code that counts how many palindromic substrings are present in a given string
def count_palindromic_substrings(s):
    def expand_around_center(left, right):
        count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return count

    total = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        total += expand_around_center(i, i)     # Odd length
        total += expand_around_center(i, i + 1) # Even length
    return total
